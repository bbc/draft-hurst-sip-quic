--- abstract

This document describes a mapping of Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) semantics over QUIC Transport. It allows the
creation, modification and termination of media sessions with one or more participants, possibly carried over the same
QUIC transport connection, using RTP/AVP directly, or some mixture of both.

SIP version 3 (SIP/3) enables a more efficient use of network resources by introducing field compression to the header
fields carried in SIP transactions.

# Introduction {#introduction}

The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) {{!RFC3261}} is widely used for managing media sessions over the internet.
Examples of these media sessions include internet telephony services, video conferencing and live streaming of media.

{{SIP2.0}} uses whitespace-delimited text fields to convey SIP messages in a similar format to HTTP/1.1 {{HTTP1.1}},
and may optionally be transported over TLS (so called "SIPS"). SIP/3, as defined by this document, uses a binary
framing layer carried over QUIC streams and is protected by the mandatory TLS encryption afforded by the QUIC
transport connection. A future optional extension may introduce the ability to carry SIP messages in QUIC Datagrams
{{QUIC-DATAGRAMS}}.

## Conventions {#conventions}

{::boilerplate bcp14-tagged}

This document uses the variable-length integer encoding from {{Section 16 of QUIC-TRANSPORT}}.

Packet and frame diagrams in this document use the format described in {{Section 1.3 of QUIC-TRANSPORT}}.

## Definitions {#definitions}

The following terms are used:

abort:
: An abrupt termination of a connection or stream, possibly due to an error
  condition.

endpoint:
: Either the client or server of the connection.

connection:
: A transport-layer connection between two endpoints using QUIC as the transport protocol.

connection error:
: An error that affects the entire SIP/3 connection.

frame:
: The smallest unit of communication on a stream in SIP/3, consisting of a header and a variable-length sequence of
  bytes structured according to the frame type.

  Protocol elements called "frames" exist in both this document and {{QUIC-TRANSPORT}}. Where frames from
  {{QUIC-TRANSPORT}} are referenced, the frame name will be prefaced with "QUIC".  For example, "QUIC CONNECTION_CLOSE
  frames".  References without this preface refer to frames defined in {{frame-definitions}}.

SIP/3 connection:
: A QUIC connection where the negotiated application protocol is SIP/3.

peer:
: An endpoint.  When discussing a particular endpoint, "peer" refers to the endpoint that is remote to the primary
  subject of discussion.

receiver:
: An endpoint that is receiving frames.

sender:
: An endpoint that is transmitting frames.

stream:
: A bidirectional or unidirectional bytestream provided by the QUIC transport. All streams within an SIP/3 connection
  can be considered "SIP/3 streams", but multiple stream types are defined within SIP/3.

stream error:
: An application-level error on the individual stream.

transport client:
: The endpoint that initiates a SIP/3 connection.

transport server:
: The endpoint that accepts a SIP/3 connection.

The terms "call", "dialog", "header", "header field", "header field value", "initiator", "invitee", "message",
"method", "proxy server", "request", "(SIP) transaction", "user agent client" and "user agent server" are defined in
{{Section 6 of SIP2.0}}.

# SIP/3 Protocol Overview {#sip3-overview}

SIP/3 provides a transport for SIP semantics using the QUIC transport protocol and an internal framing layer based on
{{HTTP3}}.

Once a user agent client knows that a user agent server supports SIP/3, it opens a QUIC connection. QUIC provides
protocol negotiation, stream-based multiplexing, and flow control. SIP transactions are multiplexed across QUIC
streams, which is described in {{Section 2 of QUIC-TRANSPORT}}. Each request and response consumes a single QUIC
stream.

Within each stream, the basic unit of SIP/3 communication is a frame as described in {{framing-layer}}. Each frame type
serves a different purpose. The HEADERS and DATA frames form the basis of the offer/answer transaction model described
in {{RFC3264}} and are described in {{sip-transaction-framing}}.

In {{SIP2.0}}, some header fields may be compressed by using abbreviated versions. In SIP/3, all request and response
header fields are compressed for transmission using {{QPACK}}, in which header fields may be mapped to indexed values,
or literal values may be encoded using a static Huffman code. {{QPACK}} uses two tables for its indexed values; the
static table is predefined with common header fields and values, and the dynamic table can be used to encode frequently
used header fields to reduce repetition. Because {{QPACK}}'s static table is designed to work with {{HTTP3}}, this
specification replaces the default static table defined in {{Appendix A of QPACK}} with the table in
{{static-table}}.

## QUIC Transport {#quic-transport}

SIP/3 relies on QUIC version 1 as the underlying transport. The use of other QUIC transport versions with SIP/3 MAY be
defined by future specifications. QUIC version 1 uses TLS version 1.3 or greater as its handshake protocol. SIP/3 user
agents MUST support a mechanism to indicate the target host to the server during the TLS handshake. If the target
destination user agent server is identified by a domain name {{?RFC8499}}, clients MUST send the Server Name Indication
({{?SNI=RFC6066}}) TLS extension unless an alternative mechanism to indicate the target host is used.

QUIC connections are established as described in {{!RFC9000}}. During connection establishment, SIP/3 support is
indicated by selecting the ALPN token "sips/3" in the TLS handshake. Support for other application-layer protocols MAY
be offered in the same handshake.

> **Author's Note:** Perhaps the ALPN string should actually be "s3" instead of "sips/3", similar to h3 vs. HTTP/3?
Should probably mint the ALPN token "sips/2.0" as well, for backwards compatibility?

### Draft Version Identification {#draft-version-indication}

> **RFC Editor's Note:** Please remove this section prior to publication of a final version of this document.

Only implementations of the final, published RFC can identify themselves as "sips/3". Until such an RFC exists,
implementations MUST NOT identify themselves using this string. Implementations of draft versions of the protocol MUST
add the string "-h" and the corresponding draft number to the identifier. For example, draft-hurst-sip-quic-00 is
identified using the string "sips/3-h00".

Non-compatible experiments that are based on these draft versions MUST append the string "-" and an experiment name to
the identifier. For example, an experimental implementation based on draft-hurst-sip-quic-00 which uses QUIC datagrams
instead of QUIC streams to carry SIP messages might identify itself as "sips/3-h00-datagrams". Note that any label MUST
conform to the "token" syntax defined in {{Section 5.6.2 of HTTP-SEMANTICS}}. Experimenters are encouraged to
coordinate their experiments.

## Connection Reuse {#connection-reuse}

SIP/3 connections are persistent across multiple transactions. SIP/3 connections may also be persistent across multiple
established dialogs. A single SIP/3 connection may carry transactions for multiple distinct dialogs simultaneously,
with each dialog individually identified by the `Call-ID` header and `tag=` parameters on the `To` and `From` headers.

# Expressing SIP Semantics in SIP/3 {#sip3-semantics}

## QUIC Clients and Servers {#quic-clients-servers}

Since the intention of SIP/3 is to reuse the transport association as much as possible, this is not entirely compatible
with conventional SIP's user agent client and user agent server model. Instead, this specification introduces two new
terms, "transport client" and "transport server", to denote the QUIC client as the initiator of the transport
connection, and the QUIC server as its peer.

## SIP Transaction Framing {#sip-transaction-framing}

SIP transactions begin with a request being sent by a user agent client (UAC) on a request stream, which is a
bidirectional QUIC stream; see {{stream-mapping}}. If the user agent client making the request is accessing the
transport connection from the transport client endpoint, then the request stream is carried on a client-initiated
bidirectional QUIC stream. If the user agent client making the request is accessing the transport connection from the
transport server endpoint, then the request stream is carried on a server-initiated bidirectional QUIC stream.

Each SIP transaction has exclusive use of a request stream. Only one request may be made per request stream. The user
agent server sends zero or more provisional responses on the same stream as the request, followed by one or more final
responses. See {{Section 7.2 of SIP2.0}} for a description of provisional and final responses.

On a given request stream, receipt of multiple requests MUST be treated as malformed.

A SIP message (request or response) consists of:

1. the header section, including message control data, sent as a single HEADERS frame,
2. optionally, the message body, if present, sent as a series of DATA frames.

Headers are described in {{Section 7.3 of SIP2.0}}. Message bodies are described in {{Section 7.4 of SIP2.0}}.

Receipt of an invalid sequence of frames MUST be treated as a connection error of type SIP3_FRAME_UNEXPECTED. In
particular, a DATA frame before any HEADERS frame is considered invalid. Other frame types, especially unknown frame
types, may be permitted subject to their own rules, see {{extensions}}.

The HEADERS frame might reference updates to the QPACK dynamic table. While these updates are not directly part of the
message exchange, they MUST be received and processed before the message can be consumed.

{::comment}
The HTTP/3 spec has something about Transfer-Encoding here - SIP/2.0 has the Content-Transfer-Encoding header, should
this be also banned here?
{:/comment}

After sending a request, the client MUST close the stream for sending (see {{Section 3.4 of QUIC-TRANSPORT}}). After
sending the last final response, the server MUST close the stream for sending. At this point, the QUIC stream is fully
closed.

When a stream is closed, this indicates the completion of the SIP transaction. If a stream terminates without enough of
the request to provide a complete response, the server SHOULD abort the stream with the error code
SIP3_REQUEST_INCOMPLETE.

{::comment}
The HTTP/3 spec has a section about the server being allowed to respond before the client has finished sending an
entire request. Is this something to consider banning here too?
{:/comment}

### Request Cancellation and Rejection {#cancel-request}

Once a request stream has been opened, the request MAY be cancelled by either endpoint. A user agent client SHOULD
gracefully cancel a request by using the CANCEL frame. A user agent server receiving a `CANCEL` request (not frame)
MUST respond to the request immediately with a 405 Method Not Allowed error as described in
{{Section 21.4.6 of SIP2.0}}.

> **Author's Note:** This is because the `CSeq` header has been removed, so we can't use the `CANCEL` request.

An endpoint MAY abruptly cancel any request by resetting both the sending and receiving parts of the streams by
sending a `RESET_STREAM` frame (see {{Section 19.4 of QUIC-TRANSPORT}}) and a `STOP_SENDING` frame (see
{{Section 19.5 of QUIC-TRANSPORT}}).

When the user agent server abruptly cancels a request without performing any application processing, the request is
considered "rejected". The server SHOULD abort its response stream with the error code SIP3_REQUEST_REJECTED. In this
context, "processed" means that some data from the request stream was passed to some higher layer of software that
might have taken some action as a result. The user agent client can treat requests rejected by the user agent server as
though they had never been sent at all, and may be retried later.

User agent servers MUST NOT use the SIP3_REQUEST_REJECTED error code for requests that were partially or fully
processed. When a server abandons a response after partial processing, it SHOULD abort its response stream with
the error code SIP3_REQUEST_CANCELLED.

User agent clients SHOULD use the error code SIP3_REQUEST_CANCELLED to cancel requests. Upon receipt of this error
code, user agent servers MAY abruptly terminate the response using the error code SIP3_REQUEST_REJECTED if no
processing was performed. User agent clients MUST NOT use the SIP3_REQUEST_REJECTED error code, except when a user
agent server has requested closure of the request stream with this error code.

### Malformed requests and responses {#malformed}

A malformed request or response is one that is an otherwise valid sequence of frames but is invalid due to:

* the presence of prohibited header fields or pseudo-header fields,
* the absence of mandatory pseudo-header fields,
* invalid values for pseudo-header fields,
* pseudo-header fields after header fields,
* an invalid sequence of SIP messages, such as a message body being present before a header section,
* the inclusion of uppercase header field names,
* the inclusion of invalid characters in field names or values.

A request or response that is defined as having content when it contains a `Content-Length` header field (see
{{Section 18.3 of SIP2.0}}) is malformed if the value of the `Content-Length` header field does not equal the sum of
the DATA frame lengths received.

Intermediaries that process SIP requests or responses such as a proxy server MUST NOT forward a malformed request or
response. Malformed requests or responses that are detected MUST be treated as a stream error of type
SIP3_MESSAGE_ERROR.

For malformed requests, a user agent server MAY send an HTTP response indicating the error prior to closing or
resetting the stream. Clients MUST NOT accept a malformed response.

*[malformed]: #

## SIP Header Fields {#header-fields}

SIP messages carry metadata as a series of key-value pairs called "SIP header fields"; see {{Section 7.3 of SIP2.0}}.
For a listing of registered SIP header fields, see the "Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Parameters - Header Fields
Registry" maintained at <https://www.iana.org/assignments/sip-parameters/sip-parameters.xhtml#sip-parameters-2>.

In SIP/3, header fields are compressed and decompressed by {{QPACK}}, including the control data present in the header
section. The static table defined in {{Appendix A of QPACK}} is designed for use with HTTP, and as such contains
header fields that are of little to no interest to SIP endpoints. {{static-table}} in this document defines a
replacement static table that MUST be used with SIP/3.

A SIP/3 implementation MAY impose a limit on the maximum size of the encoded field section it will accept on an
individual SIP message using the SETTINGS_MAX_FIELD_SECTION_SIZE parameter. Unlike HTTP, there is no response code in
SIP for the size of a header block being too large. If a receiver encounters an encoded field section larger than it
has promised to accept, then it MUST treat this as stream error of type SIP3_HEADER_TOO_LARGE, and discard the
response.

{{Section 4.2 of QPACK}} describes the definition of two unidirectional stream types for the encoder and decoder
streams. The values of the types are identical when used with SIP/3, see {{unidirectional-streams}}.

To bound the memory requirements of the decoder for the QPACK dynamic table, the decoder limits the maximum value the
encoder is permitted to set for the dynamic table capacity, as specified in {{Section 3.2.3 of QPACK}}. Similarly to
HTTP/3, the dynamic table capacity is determined by the value of the SETTINGS_QPACK_MAX_TABLE_CAPACITY parameter sent
by the decoder. Use of the dynamic table can be disabled by setting this value to zero. If both endpoints disable use
of the dynamic table, then the endpoints SHOULD NOT open the encoder and decoder streams.

When the dynamic table is in use, a QPACK decoder may encounter an encoded field section that references a dynamic
table entry that it has not yet received, because QUIC does not guarantee order between data on different streams. In
this case, the stream is considered "blocked" as described in {{Section 2.1.2 of QPACK}}. As above, the HTTP/3 setting
is replicated in SIP/3 in the form of the SETTINGS_QPACK_BLOCKED_STREAMS parameter sent by the decoder, which controls
the number of streams that are allowed to be "blocked" by pending dynamic table updates. Blocked streams can be avoided
by sending Huffman-encoded literals. If a decoder encounters more blocked streams than it promised to support, it MUST
treat this as a connection error of type SIP3_HEADER_DECOMPRESSION_FAILED.

The abbreviated forms of SIP header fields described in {{Section 7.3.3 of SIP2.0}} MUST NOT be used with SIP/3.

SIP/3 endpoints MUST NOT use the `CSeq` header field (see {{Section 20.16 of SIP2.0}}). The correct order of requests
are instead inferred by the QUIC stream identifier as described in {{stream-mapping}}. Intermediaries that convert and
forward SIP/3 messages as earlier versions of SIP are responsible for defining the value carried in the `CSeq` header
field for those messages, and the mapping of those values back to the requisite SIP/3 request stream.

### Contact Header Field Version Extension {#contact-extension}

This document defines an additional `Contact` header field parameter "v". The "v" parameter carries a comma-separated
list of SIP versions which the given SIP endpoint supports in descending preference order. The ABNF (Augmented
Backus-Naur Form) syntax for the "v" parameter is given below. It follows the same syntax as defined in
{{Section 2.2 of RFC7639}}.

~~~
contact-version = "v=" DQUOTE version-list DQUOTE
version-list    = 1#protocol-id
protocol-id     = token ; percent-encoded ALPN protocol identifier
~~~
{: #fig-contact-version-abnf title="ABNF syntax for the \"v\" parameter"}

An example `Contact:` header using this extension is given below.

~~~
Contact: "Mr. Watson" <sip:watson@example.com>;
    q=0.7; expires=3600; v="sips%2F3,sips%2F2.0,sip%2F2.0",
    "Mr. Watson" <mailto:watson@example.com>; q=0.1
~~~
{: #fig-contact-version-extension-example title="Example usage of the \"v\" Contact header field parameter"}

### SIP Control Data

Similar to {{HTTP2}} and {{HTTP3}}, SIP/3 employs a series of pseudo-header fields where the field name begins with
the `:` character (ASCII 0x3a). These pseudo-header fields convey message control data, which replaces the
`Request-Line` described in {{Section 7.1 of SIP2.0}}.

Pseudo-header fields are not SIP header fields. Endpoints MUST NOT generate pseudo-header fields other than those
defined in this document. However, an extension could negotiate a modification of this restriction; see {{extensions}}.

Pseudo-header fields are only valid in the context in which they are defined. Pseudo-header fields defined for requests
MUST NOT appear in responses; pseudo-header fields defined for responses MUST NOT appear in requests. Pseudo-header
fields MUST NOT appear in trailer sections. Endpoints MUST treat a request or response that contains undefined or
invalid pseudo-header fields as malformed.

All pseudo-header fields MUST appear in the header section before regular header fields. Any request or response that
contains a pseudo-header field that appears in a header section after a regular header field MUST be treated as
malformed.

#### Request Pseudo-header fields

The following pseudo-header fields are defined for requests:

":method": Contains the SIP method. See {{methods}} to understand SIP/3-specific usages of SIP methods.

":request-uri": Contains the SIPS URI as described in {{Section 19.1 of SIP2.0}}.

All SIP/3 requests MUST include exactly one value for the `:method` and `:request-uri` pseudo-header fields. The
`SIP-Version` element of the `Request-Line` structure in {{Section 7.1 of SIP2.0}} is omitted, as the SIP version is
given by the negotiated ALPN version string as described in {{quic-transport}}, and as such all SIP/3 requests
implicitly have a protocol version of "3.0".

A SIP request that omits any mandatory pseudo-header fields or contains invalid values for those pseudo-header fields
is malformed.

#### Response Pseudo-header fields

For responses, a single ":status" pseudo-header field is defined that carries the SIP status code, see
{{Section 7.2 of SIP2.0}}.

All SIP/3 responses MUST include exactly one value for the ":status" pseudo-header field. The `SIP-Version` and
`Reason-Phrase` elements of the `Status-Line` structure in {{Section 7.2 of SIP2.0}} is omitted. The SIP version is
given by the negotiated ALPN version string as described in {{quic-transport}}, and as such all SIP/3 responses
implicitly have a protocol version of "3.0". If it is required, for example to provide a human readable string of a
received status code, the `Reason-Phrase` can be inferred from the list of reason phrases accompanying the status codes
listed in {{Section 21 of SIP2.0}}.

{: #fig-mixed-sip-versions title="Example showing mixed SIP versions"}

In the above example, the proxy initiator, invitee and proxy server identified as "Proxy A" all support SIP/3, but the
proxy server identified as "Proxy B" does not, and only supports SIP/2.0 over TCP/TLS and UDP. When Proxy A attempts to
connect to Proxy B, it may have previous knowledge of the lack of support for SIP/3 on Proxy B, or the DNS SRV record
{{?RFC2782}} may have indicated that the server only supports `_sips` services over TCP, thereby implying SIP/2.0.

If Proxy B only supported unencrypted SIP over UDP, then Proxy A MUST NOT forward messages from the secure SIP/3 over
an unencrypted protocol, as this could constitute a downgrade attack. Instead, if the designated invitee cannot be
contacted by a means other than via Proxy B, then Proxy A would return a response of `502 Bad Gateway` to the initiator
for that transaction.

When initiating direct communication with an invitee after the conclusion of the initial `INVITE`, the decision to use
SIP/3 SHOULD be performed as follows:

* If the DNS SRV record for the SIPS URI indicates that the invitee supports SIPS over UDP, or
* If the `Contact:` header field carries the "v" parameter described in {{contact-extension}} and indicates a
preference for SIP/3.

## Transactions

In {{SIP2.0}}, messages pertaining to a given SIP transaction are identified as such using the branch parameter on the
`Via:` header fields carried in requests and responses. In SIP/3, individual transactions are tracked using the QUIC
streams that are used to carry them. SIP/3 endpoints MAY omit this parameter. For intermediaries converting between
SIP/3 and other versions of SIP, these endpoints SHOULD insert missing branch parameters, which MAY simply be a textual
representation of the stream IDs used.

## Dialogs

In {{SIP2.0}}, dialogs are tracked by use of the `Call-ID:` header field and the `tag=` parameter on the `To:` and
`From:` header fields. The current document does not introduce any additional means for tracking dialogs, and as such
the `Call-ID:` and `tag=` values MUST continue to be used in SIP/3.

# Stream Mapping and Usage {#stream-mapping}

A QUIC stream provides reliable and in-order delivery of bytes on that stream, but makes no guarantees about order of
delivery with regard to bytes on other streams. The semantics of the QUIC stream layer is invisible to the SIP framing
layer. The transport layer buffers and orders received stream data, exposing a reliable byte stream to the application.
Although QUIC permits out-of-order delivery within a stream, SIP/3 does not make use of this feature.

QUIC streams can be either unidirectional, carrying data only from initiator to receiver, or bidirectional, carrying
data in both directions. Bidirectional streams are used exclusively to convey SIP/3 request and response messages;
unidirectional streams are used only for controlling the SIP/3 session itself. A bidirectional stream ensures that the
response can be readily correlated with the request. These streams are referred to as request streams.

{{SIP2.0}} is designed to run over unreliable transports such as UDP. Since QUIC guarantees reliability, some of the
features of SIP/2.0 are no longer required. User agents MUST NOT send the `CSeq` header field in requests or
responses, as the messages are already associated with a QUIC stream. Intermediaries that convert SIP/3 to SIP/2.0 and
earlier versions when forwarding message are responsible for handing the mapping of the `CSeq` header field to
individual transactions.

> **Author's note:** The author invites feedback as to whether the MUST NOT in relation to the `CSeq` header could be
relaxed to a SHOULD NOT, or whether there is a valid use case that I have not identified that means this restriction
should be relaxed even further.

If the {{QPACK}} dynamic table is used, then the unidirectional encoder and decoder streams described in
{{Section 4.2 of QPACK}} will be in operation in a SIP/3 connection.

*[bidirectional stream]: #bidirectional-streams
*[bidirectional streams]: #bidirectional-streams (((bidirectional stream)))
*[unidirectional stream]: #unidirectional-streams
*[unidirectional streams]: #unidirectional-streams (((unidirectional stream)))
*[control stream]: #control-streams
*[control streams]: #control-streams (((control stream)))

## Bidirectional Streams {#bidirectional-streams}

All bidirectional streams are used for SIP requests and responses. These streams are referred to as request streams.

## Unidirectional Streams {#unidirectional-streams}

SIP/3 makes use of unidirectional streams. The purpose of a given unidirectional stream is indicated by a stream type,
which is sent as a variable-length integer at the start of the stream. The format and structure of data that follows
this integer is determined by the stream type, as it is in {{HTTP3}}.

~~~
Unidirectional Stream Header {
  Stream Type (i),
}
~~~
{: #fig-unidirectional-stream-header title="Unidirectional Stream Header"}

One stream type is defined in this document: the control stream. In addition, the HTTP/3 stream
types defined by {{Section 4.2 of QPACK}} are mapped to the same values in SIP/3 (`0x2` for the encoder stream and
`0x3` for the decoder stream).

In addition, the stream type value of `0x4` is reserved by this document for future use as the media stream.

{::comment}
From RFC 9114:

The performance of HTTP/3 connections in the early phase of their lifetime is sensitive to the creation and exchange of data on unidirectional streams. Endpoints that excessively restrict the number of streams or the flow-control window of these streams will increase the chance that the remote peer reaches the limit early and becomes blocked. In particular, implementations should consider that remote peers may wish to exercise reserved stream behavior (Section 6.2.3) with some of the unidirectional streams they are permitted to use.
{:/comment}

Each endpoint needs to create at least one unidirectional stream for the SIP/3 control stream. If the QPACK dynamic
table is used, then each endpoint will open two additional unidirectional streams each. Other extensions might request
further streams. Therefore, the transport parameters sent by both endpoints MUST allow the peer to create at least
three unidirectional streams. These transport parameters SHOULD also provide at least 1,024 bytes of flow-control
credit to each unidirectional stream.

If the stream header indicates a stream type that is not supported by the recipient, the receiver MUST abort reading
the stream, discard incoming data without further processing, and reset the stream with the SIP3_STREAM_CREATION_ERROR
error code. The recipient MUST NOT consider unknown stream types to be a connection error of any kind.

Since certain stream types can affect connection state, a recipient SHOULD NOT discard data from incoming
unidirectional streams prior to reading the stream type.

Implementations SHOULD wait for the reception of a SETTINGS frame describing what stream types their peer supports
before sending streams of that type. Implementations MAY send stream types that do not modify the state or semantics of
existing protocol components before it is known whether the peer supports them, but MUST NOT send stream types that do
(such as QPACK).

A sender can close or reset a unidirectional stream unless otherwise specified. A receiver MUST tolerate unidirectional
streams being closed or reset prior to the reception of the unidirectional stream header.

### Control Streams {#control-streams}

A control stream is indicated by a stream type of `0x00`. Data on this stream consists of SIP/3 frames, as defined in
{{framing-layer}}.

Each endpoint MUST initiate a single control stream at the beginning of the connection and send its SETTINGS frame as
the first frame on this stream. If the first frame of the control stream is any other frame type, this MUST be treated
as a connection error of type SIP3_MISSING_SETTINGS. Only one control stream per peer is permitted; receipt of a second
stream claiming to be a control stream MUST be treated as a connection error of type SIP3_STREAM_CREATION_ERROR.

The control stream MUST NOT be closed by the sender, and the receiver MUST NOT request that the sender close the
control stream. If either control stream is closed at any point, this MUST be treated as a connection error of type
SIP3_CLOSED_CRITICAL_STREAM. Connection errors are described in {{error-handling}}.

Because the contents of the control stream are used to manage the behaviour of other streams, endpoints SHOULD provide
enough flow-control credit to keep the peer's control stream from becoming blocked.

# SIP Methods {#methods}

The `REGISTER`, `INVITE`, `ACK` and `BYE` methods as described in {{SIP2.0}} continue to operate in SIP/3 as they did
in earlier versions of the protocol.

The `CANCEL` method MUST NOT be used in SIP/3. If a request needs to be cancelled, the CANCEL frame SHOULD be used, or
the stream for that request reset. Note that even after sending a CANCEL frame or the stream reset, data may still
arrive on the stream as the messages may already be in flight by the time the CANCEL frame or QUIC RESET_STREAM frame
({{Section 19.4 of QUIC-TRANSPORT}}) is received and processed by the peer.

> **Author's note:** I have not done a comprehensive review of all SIP/2.0 extensions and their applicability to this
document, so I invite feedback on any other methods that may be problematic.

# SIP Framing Layer {#framing-layer}

SIP/3 frames are carried on QUIC streams, as described in {{stream-mapping}}. SIP/3 defines a single stream type: the
request stream. This section describes SIP/3 frame formats; see {{frame-types}} for an overview.

| Frame    | Request Stream | Control Stream | Section            |
|:---------|:---------------|:---------------|:-------------------|
| DATA     | Yes            | No             | {{data-frame}}     |
| HEADERS  | Yes            | No             | {{headers-frame}}  |
| CANCEL   | No             | Yes            | {{cancel-frame}}   |
| SETTINGS | No             | Yes            | {{settings-frame}} |
{: #frame-types "SIP/3 Frames"}

*[DATA]: #data-frame
*[HEADERS]: #headers-frame
*[CANCEL]: #cancel-frame
*[SETTINGS]: #settings-frame

Note that, unlike QUIC frames, SIP/3 frames can span multiple QUIC or UDP packets.

## Frame Layout {#frame-layout}

All frames have the following format:

~~~
SIP/3 Frame Format {
  Type (i),
  Length (i),
  Frame Payload (...)
}
~~~
{: #fig-sip-frame-format title="SIP/3 Frame Format"}

A frame includes the following fields:

* Type: A variable-length integer that identifies the frame type.

* Length: A variable-length integer that describes the length in bytes of the Frame Payload.

* Frame Payload: A payload, the semantics of which are determined by the Type field.

Each frame's payload MUST contain exactly the fields identified in its description. A frame payload that contains
additional bytes after the identified fields of a frame payload that terminates before the end of the identified
fields MUST be treated as a connection error of type SIP3_FRAME_ERROR.

When a stream terminates cleanly, if the last frame on the stream was truncated, this MUST be treated as a connection
error of type SIP3_FRAME_ERROR. Streams that terminate abruptly may be reset at any point in a frame.

## Frame Definitions {#frame-definitions}

### DATA {#data-frame}

`DATA` frames (type=`0x00`) convey arbitrary, variable-length sequences of bytes associated with the SIP request or
response content.

`DATA` frames MUST be associated with a SIP request or response.

~~~
DATA Frame {
  Type (i) = 0x00,
  Length (i),
  Data (..)
}
~~~
{: #fig-sip-data-frame-format title="DATA Frame"}

### HEADERS {#headers-frame}

`HEADERS` frames (type=`0x01`) are used to carry the collection of SIP header fields that are associated with a SIP
request or response as described in {{header-fields}} that is encoded using {{QPACK}}.

~~~
HEADERS Frame {
  Type (i) = 0x01,
  Length (i),
  Encoded Field Section (..)
}
~~~
{: #fig-sip-headers-frame-format title="HEADERS Frame"}

### CANCEL {#cancel-frame}

The `CANCEL` frame (type=`0x02`) is only sent on the control stream and informs the receiver that its peer that it does
not wish for the receiver to do any further processing on the message carried by the associated bidirectional stream
ID. If the receiver has already completed the processing for the message, sent the response and closed the sending end
of the stream, it MUST discard this frame.

> **Author's Note:** Remove the length from this frame type as the stream ID field is self-describing.

~~~
CANCEL Frame {
  Type (i) = 0x02,
  Length (i),
  Stream ID (i)
}
~~~
{: #fig=sip-cancel-frame-format title="CANCEL Frame"}

Senders MUST NOT send this stream with a stream ID that has not been acknowledged by its peer. Endpoints that receive
a `CANCEL` frame with a stream ID that has not yet been opened MUST respond with a connection error of type
SIP3_CANCEL_STREAM_CLOSED error.

### SETTINGS {#settings-frame}

The `SETTINGS` frame (type=`0x04`) conveys configuration parameters that affect how endpoints communicate, such as
preferences and constraints on peer behaviour. The parameters always apply to an entire SIP/3 connection, never a
single stream. A `SETTINGS` frame MUST be sent as the first frame of each control stream by each peer, and it MUST NOT
be sent subsequently. If an endpoint receives a second `SETTINGS` frame on the control stream, or any other stream, the
endpoint MUST respond with a connection error of type SIP3_FRAME_UNEXPECTED.

`SETTINGS` parameters are not negotiated; they describe characteristics of the sending peer that can be used by the
receiving peer. However, a negotiation can be implied by the use of `SETTINGS`: each peer uses `SETTINGS` to advertise
a set of supported values. Each peer combines the two sets to conclude which choice will be used. `SETTINGS` does not
provide a mechanism to identify when the choice takes effect.

Different values for the same parameter can be advertised by each peer. The same parameter MUST NOT occur more than
once in the `SETTINGS` frame. A receiver MAY treat the presence of duplicate setting identifiers as a connection error
of type SIP3_SETTINGS_ERROR.

The payload of a `SETTINGS` frame consists of zero or more parameters. Each parameter consists of a parameter
identifier and a value, both encoded as QUIC variable-length integers.

~~~
Parameter {
  Identifier (i),
  Value (i)
}

SETTINGS Frame {
  Type (i) = 0x04,
  Length (i),
  Parameter (..) ...
}
~~~
{: #fig-sip-settings-frame-format title="SETTINGS Frame"}

An implementation MUST ignore any parameter with an identifier it does not understand.

#### Defined SETTINGS Parameters {#defined-settings}

The following parameters are defined in SIP/3:

SETTINGS_QPACK_MAX_TABLE_CAPACITY (`0x01`):
: The default value is zero. See {{header-fields}} for usage.

# Extensions to SIP/3 {#extensions}

SIP/3 permits extension of the protocol. Within the limitations described in this section, protocol extensions can be
used to provide additional services or alter any aspect of the protocol. Extensions are effective only within the scope
of a single SIP/3 connection.

This applies only to the protocol elements defined in this document. This does not affect the existing options for
extending SIP, such as defining new methods, status codes or header fields.

Extensions are permitted to use new frame types ({{frame-definitions}}), new settings ({{defined-settings}}), new error
codes ({{error-codes}}), or new stream types ({{stream-mapping}}).

> **RFC Editor's Note:** Establish registries for frame types, settings, error codes and stream types.

Implementations MUST ignore unknown or unsupported values in all extensible protocol elements. This means that any of
these extension points can be safely used by extensions without prior arrangement or negotiation. However, where a
known frame type is required to be in a specific location, such as the SETTINGS frame (see {{control-streams}}), an
unknown frame type does not satisfy that requirement and SHOULD be treated as an error.

Extensions that could change the semantics of existing protocol components MUST be negotiated before being used. For
example, an extension that allows the multiplexing of other protocols such as media transport protocols over
bidirectional QUIC streams MUST NOT be used until the peer has given a positive signal that this is acceptable.

This document does not mandate a specific method for negotiating the use of any extension, but it notes that a
parameter ({{defined-settings}}) could be used for that purpose. If both peers set a value that indicates willingness
to use the extension, then the extension can be used. If a parameter is used in this way, the default value MUST be
defined in such a way that the extension is disabled if the setting is omitted.

# Future Carriage of Media Sessions {#media-sessions}

Future versions of this specification may include support for carrying media sessions within the same QUIC transport
connection as SIP/3, with the intention being that they will be negotiated using the SDP offer/answer mechanism.

There already exists several attempts to define carriage of media over QUIC transport, such as {{QRT}},
{{RTP-over-QUIC}}, {{QuicR-Arch}}, {{RUSH}} and {{Warp}}.

In the case of media carried in QUIC datagrams, a user agent cannot propose sending media using this mechanism unless
its peer has indicated its support for receiving datagrams by means of the `max_datagram_frame_size` parameter as
described in {{Section 3 of QUIC-DATAGRAMS}}.

In the case of media carried in QUIC streams, if the media streams are transmitted using unidirectional streams, then
new stream types will need to be defined. This document reserves the stream type value 0x04 for this, see
{{unidirectional-streams}}. In the unlikely case where media streams are to be transmitted using bidirectional streams,
the stream type mechanism will need to be extended to cover bidirectional streams, as SIP/3 currently assumes that SIP
messages have exclusive use of the bidirectional streams.

## Carriage of RTP in a QUIC Transport Session

Both {{QRT}} and {{RTP-over-QUIC}} define ways to carry RTP and RTCP messages over QUIC DATAGRAMs, and with SIP and SDP
already closely aligned with RTP media sessions it stands to reason that adapting SIP/3 to coexist within the same QUIC
transport connection would save at least a round trip.

QRT only defines a way to carry RTP and RTCP in QUIC DATAGRAMs. RTP-over-QUIC defines a way to carry RTP and RTCP over
QUIC streams (without specifying whether they are to be sent over bi- or unidirectional streams) and QUIC DATAGRAMs.

QRT attempts to define SDP attributes to allow the negotiation of QRT sessions in SIP. {{SDP-QUIC}} also describes
a different set of SDP attributes to perform a similar task.

Future versions of this document or the above documents may specify a mechanism for signalling that a given media
session will be carried in the same QUIC connection that the SIP/3 session is going to be carried in.

## Carriage of non-RTP media streaming protocols in a QUIC Transport Session

{{RUSH}} does not specify a means to discover the presence of a RUSH streaming session, nor a mechanism for negotiating
the encoding parameters of media that is being exchanged. RUSH has two modes of operation, Normal and Multi Stream
modes. Normal mode, as described in {{Section 4.3.1 of RUSH}}, uses a single bidirectional QUIC stream to send and
receive media streams. Multi Stream mode, as described in {{Section 4.3.2 of RUSH}}, uses a bidirectional QUIC
stream for each individual frame. Bidirectional streams appear to be used in order to give error feedback, as opposed
to having a separate control stream for handling errors or using the QUIC transport error mechanism. If the stream type
mechanism described in {{unidirectional-streams}} is expanded to cover bidirectional streams as well, then SIP/3 could
be used with RUSH.

{{Warp}} specifies that sessions are established using HTTP/3 WebTransport ({{WebTransH3}}). However, to the author's
best knowledge WebTransport does not yet contain any signalling or media negotiation similar to how WebRTC would use
SDP offer/answer exchanges, so some form of session establishment mechanism like SIP/3 could be used. Warp uses
unidirectional streams for sending media. Media is sent in ISO-BMFF "segments", similar to MPEG-DASH, with each stream
carrying a single segment. This can easily be used with the reserved media stream type reserved in
{{unidirectional-streams}}.

{{QuicR-Arch}} is openly hostile to the usage of SDP, and {{QuicR-Proto}} defines the QuicR Manifest for advertising
media sessions and endpoint capabilities, and as such SIP/3 probably isn't required.

### Stream Types {#iana-stream-types}

This document establishes a registry for SIP/3 stream types. The "SIP/3 Stream Types" registry governs a 62-bit space.
This registry follows the QUIC registry policy; see {{iana-registries}}. Permanent registrations in this registry are
assigned using the Specification Required policy {{!RFC8126}}), except for values between `0x00` and `0x3f` (in
hexadecimal; inclusive), which are assigned using Standards Action or IESG Approval as defined in
{{Sections 4.9 and 4.10 of RFC8126}}.

In addition to common fields as described in {{iana-registries}}, permanent registrations in this registry MUST include
the following fields:

Stream Type:
: A name or label for the stream type.

Sender:
: Which endpoint on a SIP/3 connection may initiate a stream of this type. Values are "Client", "Server", or "Both".

The entries is {{fig-iana-stream-type-table}} are registered by this document.

|:---------------------|:-------|:---------------------------|:-------|
| Stream Type          | Value  | Specification              | Sender |
|:---------------------|:-------|:---------------------------|:-------|
| Control Stream       | `0x00` | {{control-streams}}        | Both   |
| QPACK Encoder Stream | `0x02` | {{unidirectional-streams}} | Both   |
| QPACK Decoder Stream | `0x03` | {{unidirectional-streams}} | Both   |
| Reserved             | `0x04` | {{unidirectional-streams}} | Both   |

# QPACK Static Table {#static-table}

> **Author's Note:** This is only a preliminary table. The original HPACK static table was created after analysing the
frequency of common HTTP header fields and their values, and QPACK repeated that effort and resulted in a different
static table. The author welcomes any data that would permit a similar level of analysis for the frequency of common
SIP header fields and their values.
