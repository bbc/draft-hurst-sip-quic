--- abstract

This document describes a mapping of Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) semantics over QUIC Transport. It allows the
creation, modification and termination of media sessions with one or more participants, possibly carried over the same
QUIC transport connection, using RTP/AVP directly, or some mixture of both.

SIP-over-QUIC enables a more efficient use of network resources by introducing field compression to the header
fields carried in SIP transactions.

# Introduction {#introduction}

The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) {{!RFC3261}} is widely used for managing media sessions over the Internet.
Examples of these media sessions include Internet telephony services, video conferencing and live streaming of media.

{{SIP2.0}} uses whitespace-delimited text fields to convey SIP messages in a similar format to HTTP/1.1 {{HTTP1.1}},
and may optionally be transported over TLS (so-called "SIPS"). SIP-over-QUIC, as defined by this document, uses a binary
framing layer carried over QUIC streams and is protected by the mandatory TLS encryption afforded by the QUIC
transport connection.

> **Author's Note:** A future optional extension may introduce the ability to carry SIP messages in QUIC Datagrams
{{QUIC-DATAGRAMS}}.

## Conventions {#conventions}

{::boilerplate bcp14-tagged}

This document uses the variable-length integer encoding from {{Section 16 of QUIC-TRANSPORT}}.

Packet and frame diagrams in this document use the format described in {{Section 1.3 of QUIC-TRANSPORT}}.

## Definitions {#definitions}

The following terms are used:

abort:
: An abrupt termination of a connection or stream, possibly due to an error
  condition.

endpoint:
: Either the client or server of the connection.

connection:
: A transport-layer connection between two endpoints using QUIC as the transport protocol.

connection error:
: An error that affects the entire SIP-over-QUIC connection.

frame:
: The smallest unit of communication on a stream in SIP-over-QUIC, consisting of a header and a variable-length sequence
  of bytes structured according to the frame type.

  Protocol elements called "frames" exist in both this document and {{QUIC-TRANSPORT}}. Where frames from
  {{QUIC-TRANSPORT}} are referenced, the frame name will be prefaced with "QUIC".  For example, "QUIC CONNECTION_CLOSE
  frames".  References without this preface refer to frames defined in {{frame-definitions}}.

peer:
: An endpoint.  When discussing a particular endpoint, "peer" refers to the endpoint that is remote to the primary
  subject of discussion.

receiver:
: An endpoint that is receiving frames.

sender:
: An endpoint that is transmitting frames.

SIP/2.0:
: The SIP/2.0 specification as described in RFC3261 {{SIP2.0}}.

SIP-over-QUIC connection:
: A QUIC connection where the negotiated application protocol is SIP-over-QUIC.

stream:
: A bidirectional or unidirectional bytestream provided by the QUIC transport. All streams within an SIP-over-QUIC
  connection can be considered "SIP-over-QUIC streams", but multiple stream types are defined within SIP-over-QUIC.

stream error:
: An application-level error on the individual stream.

transport client:
: The endpoint that initiates a SIP-over-QUIC connection.

transport server:
: The endpoint that accepts a SIP-over-QUIC connection.

The terms "call", "dialog", "header", "header field", "header field value", "initiator", "invitee", "message",
"method", "proxy server", "request", "(SIP) transaction", "user agent client" and "user agent server" are defined in
{{Section 6 of SIP2.0}}.

# SIP-over-QUIC Protocol Overview {#sip3-overview}

SIP-over-QUIC provides a transport for SIP semantics using the QUIC transport protocol and an internal framing layer
inspired by {{HTTP3}}.

Once a user agent client knows that a user agent server supports SIP-over-QUIC, it opens a QUIC connection. QUIC
provides protocol negotiation, stream-based multiplexing, and flow control services to the SIP-over-QUIC transaction
layer above. SIP transactions are multiplexed across QUIC streams as described in {{Section 2 of QUIC-TRANSPORT}}. Each
request and response message pair in a SIP-over-QUIC transaction consumes a single QUIC stream.

Within each QUIC stream, the basic unit of SIP-over-QUIC communication is a frame as described in {{framing-layer}}.
Each frame type serves a different purpose. The HEADERS and DATA frames form the basis of the offer/answer transaction
model described in {{RFC3264}} and are described in {{sip-transaction-framing}}.

In {{SIP2.0}}, some header fields may be compressed by using abbreviated versions. In SIP-over-QUIC, all request and
response header fields are compressed for transmission using {{QPACK}}, in which header fields may be mapped to indexed
values, or literal values may be encoded using a codepoint in a Huffman table. {{QPACK}} uses two tables for its indexed
values: the static table is predefined with common SIP header fields and values, and the dynamic table can be used to
encode frequently used header fields in a SIP-over-QUIC connection to reduce repetition. Because {{QPACK}}'s static
table is designed to work with {{HTTP3}}, this specification replaces the default static table defined in
{{Appendix A of QPACK}} with the one in {{static-table}}.

## QUIC Transport {#quic-transport}

SIP-over-QUIC relies on QUIC version 1 as the underlying transport. The use of other QUIC transport versions with
SIP-over-QUIC MAY be defined by future specifications.

QUIC connections are established as described in {{!RFC9000}}. During connection establishment, SIP-over-QUIC support is
indicated by selecting the ALPN token "sips/quic" in the TLS handshake. Support for other application-layer protocols
MAY be offered in the same handshake.

> **Author's Note:** The original intention of this document was to define the next major version of SIP, i.e. SIPv3.
Therefore, the future ALPN token could be `sips/3` or `s3` (similarly to `h2`/`h3`).

QUIC version 1 uses TLS version 1.3 or greater as its handshake protocol. SIP-over-QUIC user agents MUST support a
mechanism to indicate the target host to the server during the TLS handshake. If the target destination user agent
server is identified by a domain name {{?RFC8499}}, clients MUST send the Server Name Indication ({{?SNI=RFC6066}}) TLS
extension unless an alternative mechanism to indicate the target host is used.

SIP-over-QUIC messages are carried in reliable QUIC streams; therefore, the SIP-over-QUIC protocol defined by this
document is a reliable SIP transport. Thus, client and server transactions using SIP-over-QUIC for transport MUST follow
the procedures and timer values for reliable transports as defined in {{SIP2.0}}.

### Draft Version Identification {#draft-version-indication}

> **RFC Editor's Note:** Please remove this section prior to publication of a final version of this document.

Only implementations of the final, published RFC can identify themselves as "sips/quic". Until such an RFC exists,
implementations MUST NOT identify themselves using this string. Implementations of draft versions of the protocol MUST
add the string "-h" and the corresponding draft number to the identifier. For example, draft-hurst-sip-quic-00 is
identified using the string "sips/quic-h00".

Non-compatible experiments that are based on these draft versions MUST append the string "-" and an experiment name to
the identifier. For example, an experimental implementation based on draft-hurst-sip-quic-00 which uses QUIC datagrams
instead of QUIC streams to carry SIP messages might identify itself as "sips/quic-h00-datagrams". Note that any label
MUST conform to the "token" syntax defined in {{Section 5.6.2 of HTTP-SEMANTICS}}. Experimenters are encouraged to
coordinate their experiments.

## Connection Reuse {#connection-reuse}

SIP-over-QUIC connections are persistent across multiple request-response transactions. A SIP-over-QUIC connection MAY
also be shared by multiple concurrent dialogs, with each dialog individually identified by the `Call-ID` header and
`tag=` parameters on the `To` and `From` headers.

# Expressing SIP Semantics Over QUIC Transport {#sip3-semantics}

## QUIC Clients and Servers {#quic-clients-servers}

This specification introduces two new terms: "transport client" to denote the host that initiates the QUIC transport
connection for exchanging SIP-over-QUIC messages, and "transport server" as its peer. These terms are orthogonal to
SIP's concepts of user agent client (UAC) and user agent server (UAS): transport clients and servers may take on either
role in the SIP-over-QUIC connection.

## SIP Transaction Framing {#sip-transaction-framing}

SIP-over-QUIC transactions begin with a request message sent by a UAC on a request stream, which is a bidirectional QUIC
stream; see {{stream-mapping}}. If the user agent client making the request is accessing the transport connection from
the transport client endpoint, then the request stream is carried on a client-initiated bidirectional QUIC stream. If
the user agent client making the request is accessing the transport connection from the transport server endpoint,
then the request stream is carried on a server-initiated bidirectional QUIC stream.

Each SIP-over-QUIC transaction has exclusive use of a request stream. Only one request is made per request stream. The
UAS sends zero or more provisional responses on the same stream as the request, followed by one or more final responses.
See {{Section 7.2 of SIP2.0}} for a description of provisional and final responses.

On a given request stream, receipt of multiple requests MUST be treated as malformed.

A SIP message (request or response) consists of:

1. the header section, including message control data, sent in SIP-over-QUIC as a single HEADERS frame,
2. optionally, the message body, if present, sent in SIP-over-QUIC as a series of DATA frames.

Headers are described in {{Section 7.3 of SIP2.0}}. Message bodies are described in {{Section 7.4 of SIP2.0}}.

Receipt of an invalid sequence of frames MUST be treated as a connection error of type SIP_FRAME_UNEXPECTED. In
particular, a DATA frame received before any HEADERS frame is considered invalid. Other frame types, especially unknown
frame types, MAY be permitted, subject to their own rules, see {{extensions}}.

The HEADERS frame might reference updates to the QPACK dynamic table. While these updates are not directly part of the
message exchange, they MUST be received and processed before the message can be consumed.

{::comment}
The HTTP/3 spec has something about Transfer-Encoding here - SIP/2.0 has the Content-Transfer-Encoding header, should
this be also banned here?
{:/comment}

After sending a request, the UAC MUST close the stream for sending (see {{Section 3.4 of QUIC-TRANSPORT}}). After
sending the last final response, the UAS MUST close the stream for sending. At this point, the QUIC stream is fully
closed.

When a stream is closed, this indicates the completion of the SIP-over-QUIC transaction. If a stream terminates without
enough of the request to provide a complete response, the UAS SHOULD abort the stream with the error code
SIP_REQUEST_INCOMPLETE.

{::comment}
The HTTP/3 spec has a section about the server being allowed to respond before the client has finished sending an
entire request. Is this something to consider banning here too?
{:/comment}

### Request Cancellation and Rejection {#cancel-request}

Once a request stream has been opened, the request MAY be cancelled by either endpoint for the reasons given in
{{Section 9 of SIP2.0}}. Cancellations are categorised as either graceful or abrupt. An endpoint MAY abruptly cancel
any request by resetting the stream using a `RESET_STREAM` frame and aborting the reception of further data on that
stream using a `STOP_SENDING` frame as described in {{Section 2.4 of QUIC-TRANSPORT}}.

The UAC SHOULD gracefully cancel requests if the response is no longer of interest by using the `CANCEL` frame. For
example, where a UAC is attempting to reach a user at multiple endpoints, and has already received a final response
from one endpoint that it is satisfied with.

UACs MAY use the error code SIP_REQUEST_CANCELLED to abruptly cancel requests. Upon receipt of this error code, a
UAS MAY abruptly terminate the response using the error code SIP_REQUEST_REJECTED if no processing was performed.
A UAC MUST NOT use the SIP_REQUEST_REJECTED error code, except when the corresponding UAS has requested closure of the
request stream with this error code.

A UAS receiving a `CANCEL` request (not frame) MUST respond to the request immediately with a 405 Method Not Allowed
error as described in Section 21.4.6 of [SIP2.0]. A user agent server receiving a `CANCEL` frame for a stream that has
not been opened MUST be treated as a connection error of type SIP_CANCEL_FRAME_CLOSED.

> **Author's Note:** This is because the `CSeq` header has been removed, so the `CANCEL` request method cannot be used.

The UAS cancels requests if they are unable or choose not to respond. UAS cancellations are always abrupt cancellations.
When a UAS abruptly cancels a request without performing any application processing, the request is considered
"rejected". In this case, the UAS SHOULD abort its response stream with the error code SIP_REQUEST_REJECTED. (In this
context, "processed" means that some data from the request stream was passed to some higher layer of software that might
have taken some action as a result.) The UAC MAY treat a request rejected by the UAS as though it had never been sent at
all, and may retry the request later.

A UAS MUST NOT use the SIP_REQUEST_REJECTED error code for requests that were partially or fully processed. When a UAS
abandons a response after partial processing, it SHOULD abort its response stream with the error code
SIP_REQUEST_CANCELLED.

### Malformed Requests And Responses {#malformed}

A malformed request or response is one that is a sequence of syntactically valid `SIP-over-QUIC` frames but that is
invalid due to:

* an invalid sequence of SIP-over-QUIC frames, such as a DATA frame preceding a HEADERS frame,
* the presence of prohibited header fields or pseudo-header fields in a HEADERS frame,
* the absence of mandatory pseudo-header fields in a HEADERS frame,
* invalid values for pseudo-header fields in a HEADERS frame,
* pseudo-header fields after header fields in a HEADERS frame,
* the inclusion of uppercase header field names in a HEADERS frame,
* the inclusion of invalid characters in field names or values in a HEADERS frame.

A request or response that is defined as having content when it contains a `Content-Length` header field (see
{{Section 18.3 of SIP2.0}}) is malformed if the value of the `Content-Length` header field does not equal the sum of
the received `DATA` frame lengths.

Intermediaries that process SIP-over-QUIC request or response messages (such as a proxy server) MUST NOT forward a
malformed request or response. Malformed requests or responses that are detected MUST be treated as a stream error of
type SIP_MESSAGE_ERROR.

A UAS MAY respond to a malformed request, indicating the error prior to closing or resetting the stream.

A UAC MUST NOT accept a malformed response.

*[malformed]: #

## SIP Header Fields {#header-fields}

SIP messages carry metadata as a series of key-value pairs called "SIP header fields"; see {{Section 7.3 of SIP2.0}}.
For a listing of registered SIP header fields, see the "Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Parameters - Header Fields
Registry" maintained at <https://www.iana.org/assignments/sip-parameters/sip-parameters.xhtml#sip-parameters-2>.

### SIP-over-QUIC Header Compression

The abbreviated forms of SIP header fields described in {{Section 7.3.3 of SIP2.0}} MUST NOT be used with SIP-over-QUIC.
Instead, header fields (including the control data present in the header section) are compressed an decompressed
using the {{QPACK}} codec.

A SIP-over-QUIC implementation MAY impose a limit on the maximum size of the encoded field section it will accept for an
individual SIP message using the SETTINGS_MAX_FIELD_SECTION_SIZE parameter. Unlike HTTP, there is no response code in
SIP for the size of a header block being too large. If a user agent receives an encoded field section larger than it
has promised to accept, it MUST treat this as stream error of type SIP_HEADER_TOO_LARGE, and discard the response.

{{Section 4.2 of QPACK}} describes the definition of two unidirectional stream types for the encoder and decoder
streams. The values of these stream types are identical when used with SIP-over-QUIC, see {{unidirectional-streams}}.

The static table defined in {{Appendix A of QPACK}} is designed for use with HTTP and, as such, contains header
fields that are of little interest to SIP endpoints. {{static-table}} in this document defines a replacement
static table that MUST be used by SIP-over-QUIC transport clients and servers.

To bound the memory requirements of the decoder for the QPACK dynamic table, the decoder limits the maximum value the
encoder is permitted to set for the dynamic table capacity, as specified in {{Section 3.2.3 of QPACK}}. The dynamic
table capacity is determined by the value of the SETTINGS_QPACK_MAX_TABLE_CAPACITY parameter sent by the decoder. Use
of the dynamic table can be disabled by setting this value to zero. If both endpoints disable use of the dynamic table,
then the endpoints SHOULD NOT open the encoder and decoder streams.

When the dynamic table is in use, a QPACK decoder may encounter an encoded field section that references a dynamic
table entry that it has not yet received, because QUIC does not guarantee order between data on different streams. In
this case, the stream is considered "blocked" as described in {{Section 2.1.2 of QPACK}}. The HTTP/3 setting
SETTINGS_QPACK_BLOCKED_STREAMS is replicated as a SIP-over-QUIC parameter, set by the recipient, determines the maximum
number of streams that are allowed to be "blocked" by pending dynamic table updates. If a decoder encounters more
blocked streams than it promised to support, it MUST treat this as a connection error of type
SIP_HEADER_DECOMPRESSION_FAILED.

Stream blocking can be avoided by sending Huffman-encoded literals instead of updating the QPACK dynamic table.

### SIP Control Data

SIP-over-QUIC employs a series of pseudo-header fields where the field name begins with the `:` character (ASCII 0x3a).
These pseudo-header fields convey message control data, which replaces the `Request-Line` described in
{{Section 7.1 of SIP2.0}}.

Pseudo-header fields are not SIP header fields. Endpoints MUST NOT generate pseudo-header fields other than those
defined in this document. However, an extension could negotiate a modification of this restriction; see {{extensions}}.

Pseudo-header fields are only valid in the context in which they are defined. Pseudo-header fields defined for requests
MUST NOT appear in responses; pseudo-header fields defined for responses MUST NOT appear in requests. Pseudo-header
fields MUST NOT appear in trailer sections. Endpoints MUST treat a request or response that contains undefined or
invalid pseudo-header fields as malformed.

All pseudo-header fields MUST appear in the header section before regular header fields. Any request or response that
contains a pseudo-header field that appears in a header section after a regular header field MUST be treated as
malformed.

#### Request Pseudo-header fields

The following pseudo-header fields are defined for requests:

* ":method": Contains the SIP method. See {{methods}} to understand SIP-over-QUIC-specific usages of SIP methods.

* ":request-uri": Contains the SIPS URI as described in {{Section 19.1 of SIP2.0}}.

All SIP-over-QUIC requests MUST include exactly one value for the `:method` and `:request-uri` pseudo-header fields. The
`SIP-Version` element of the `Request-Line` structure in {{Section 7.1 of SIP2.0}} is omitted, and all SIP-over-QUIC
requests implicitly have a protocol version of "2.0".

A SIP request that omits any mandatory pseudo-header fields or contains invalid values for those pseudo-header fields
is malformed.

#### Response Pseudo-header fields

For responses, a single ":status" pseudo-header field is defined that carries the SIP status code, see
{{Section 7.2 of SIP2.0}}.

All SIP-over-QUIC responses MUST include exactly one value for the ":status" pseudo-header field. The `SIP-Version` and
`Reason-Phrase` elements of the `Status-Line` structure in {{Section 7.2 of SIP2.0}} are omitted, and all SIP-over-QUIC
responses implicitly have a protocol version of "2.0". If it is required, for example to provide a human readable string
of a received status code, the `Reason-Phrase` can be inferred from the list of reason phrases accompanying the status
codes listed in {{Section 21 of SIP2.0}}.

### Via Transport Parameter

The Via header field in SIP messages carry a transport protocol identifier. This document defines the value "QUIC" to
be used for SIP-over-QUIC requests over QUIC transport.

The updated ABNF (Augmented Backus-Naur Form) {{?RFC5234}} for this parameter is the following:

~~~
transport  =/  "QUIC"
~~~

A full example `Via:` header is as follows:

~~~
Via: SIP/2.0/QUIC wxp6O3dffes2.example.com;branch=z9hG4bKXG1gNkhgOiNR
~~~

### SIP URI Transport Parameter {#sip-uri-transport}

This document defines the value "quic" as the transport parameter value for a SIP-over-QUIC URI {{!RFC3986}} where the
transport mechanism used for sending SIP messages will be QUIC transport, extending the parameter names defined in
{{Section 19.1.1 of SIP2.0}}.

The updated ABNF for this parameter is the following:

~~~
transport-param  =/  "transport=" "quic"
~~~

### Transaction Sequence Number {#cseq}

SIP-over-QUIC endpoints MUST NOT use the `CSeq` header field (see {{Section 20.16 of SIP2.0}}). The correct order of
SIP-over-QUIC transactions is instead inferred from the QUIC stream identifier as described in {{stream-mapping}}.
Intermediaries that forward SIP-over-QUIC messages to SIP sessions running over other transports are responsible for
defining the value carried in the `CSeq` header field for those messages, and for mapping those values back to the
correct SIP-over-QUIC request stream in the opposite direction.

## Connection Keep-Alive {#keep-alive}

SIP-over-QUIC endpoints may keep their QUIC connection active and open by sending periodic `PING` frames to defer the
QUIC idle timeout as described in {{Section 10.1.2 of QUIC-TRANSPORT}}.

{: #fig-mixed-sip-transports title="Example showing mixed SIP transports"}

In the above example, the Initiator, Invitee and the proxy server identified as "Proxy A" all support SIP-over-QUIC, but
the proxy server identified as "Proxy B" only supports SIP/2.0 over TCP/TLS and UDP. When Proxy A attempts to connect to
Proxy B, it may have previous knowledge of the lack of support for SIP-over-QUIC on Proxy B, or either of the DNS SRV
record {{?RFC2782}} or DNS service binding record {{DNS-SVCB}} may have indicated that the server only supports SIPS
services over TCP, thereby implying SIP/2.0.

If Proxy B only supports unencrypted SIP over UDP, then Proxy A MUST NOT forward messages from the secure SIP-over-QUIC
over an unencrypted protocol because this could constitute a downgrade attack. Instead, if the designated Invitee cannot
be contacted by means other than via Proxy B, then Proxy A MUST return a response of `502 Bad Gateway` to the initiator
for that transaction.

When initiating direct communication with an invitee after the conclusion of the initial `INVITE` transaction,
SIP-over-QUIC SHOULD be used if:

* The DNS SRV record for the SIPS URI indicates that the invitee supports SIPS over UDP, or
* The DNS service binding record for the SIPS URI indicates the `sips/quic` ALPN token as described in
{{quic-transport}}, or
* The `Contact:` header field indicates a SIPS URI carrying the "quic" transport parameter as described in
{{sip-uri-transport}}.

## Transactions

In {{SIP2.0}}, messages pertaining to a given SIP transaction are identified as such using the branch parameter on the
`Via:` header fields carried in requests and responses. In SIP-over-QUIC, individual transactions are tracked using the
QUIC streams that are used to carry them. SIP-over-QUIC endpoints MAY omit this parameter. For intermediaries converting
between SIP-over-QUIC and SIP sessions running over other transport protocols, these endpoints SHOULD insert missing
branch parameters. To avoid leaking details of the QUIC transport connection, these converted branch parameters MUST NOT
be textual representations of the stream IDs used to carry a given transactions, or any other representation that could
be used to infer stream IDs that have been used in a given QUIC transport connection.

## Dialogs

In {{SIP2.0}}, dialogs are tracked by use of the `Call-ID:` header field and the `tag=` parameter on the `To:` and
`From:` header fields. The current document does not introduce any additional means for tracking dialogs, and as such
the `Call-ID:` and `tag=` values MUST continue to be used in SIP-over-QUIC.

# Stream Mapping and Usage {#stream-mapping}

A QUIC stream provides reliable and in-order delivery of bytes on that stream, but makes no guarantees about order of
delivery with regard to bytes on other streams. The semantics of the QUIC stream layer is opaque to the SIP framing
layer. The transport layer buffers and orders received stream data, exposing a reliable byte stream to the application.
Although QUIC permits out-of-order delivery within a stream, SIP-over-QUIC does not make use of this feature.

QUIC streams can be either unidirectional, carrying data only from initiator to receiver, or bidirectional, carrying
data in both directions. In the context of this specification, bidirectional streams are used to convey SIP-over-QUIC
request and response messages; unidirectional streams are used only for controlling the SIP-over-QUIC session itself. A
bidirectional stream ensures that the response can be readily correlated with the request. These streams are referred to
as request streams.

{{SIP2.0}} is designed to run over unreliable transports such as UDP. Since QUIC guarantees reliability, some of the
features of SIP/2.0 are not required. User agents MUST NOT send the `CSeq` header field in requests or responses
because the messages are already associated with a QUIC stream. Intermediaries that convert SIP-over-QUIC to other
transport protocols when forwarding messages are responsible for handing the mapping of the `CSeq` header field to
individual transactions.

> **Author's note:** The author invites feedback as to whether the MUST NOT in relation to the `CSeq` header could be
relaxed to a SHOULD NOT, or whether there is a valid use case that I have not identified that means this restriction
should be relaxed even further.

If the {{QPACK}} dynamic table is used, then the unidirectional encoder and decoder streams described in
{{Section 4.2 of QPACK}} will be in operation in a SIP-over-QUIC connection.

*[bidirectional stream]: #bidirectional-streams
*[bidirectional streams]: #bidirectional-streams (((bidirectional stream)))
*[unidirectional stream]: #unidirectional-streams
*[unidirectional streams]: #unidirectional-streams (((unidirectional stream)))
*[control stream]: #control-streams
*[control streams]: #control-streams (((control stream)))

## Bidirectional Streams {#bidirectional-streams}

Bidirectional QUIC streams are used for SIP requests and responses. These streams are referred to as request streams.

## Unidirectional Streams {#unidirectional-streams}

SIP-over-QUIC makes use of unidirectional QUIC streams. The purpose of a given unidirectional stream is indicated by a
stream type, which is sent as a variable-length integer at the start of the stream. The format and structure of data
that follows this integer is determined by the stream type.

~~~
Unidirectional Stream Header {
  Stream Type (i),
}
~~~
{: #fig-unidirectional-stream-header title="Unidirectional Stream Header"}

One stream type is defined in this document: the control stream. In addition, the HTTP/3 stream
types defined by {{Section 4.2 of QPACK}} are mapped to the same values in SIP-over-QUIC (`0x2` for the encoder stream
and `0x3` for the decoder stream).

In addition, the stream type value of `0x4` is reserved by this document for future use as the media stream.

{::comment}
From RFC 9114:

The performance of HTTP/3 connections in the early phase of their lifetime is sensitive to the creation and exchange of data on unidirectional streams. Endpoints that excessively restrict the number of streams or the flow-control window of these streams will increase the chance that the remote peer reaches the limit early and becomes blocked. In particular, implementations should consider that remote peers may wish to exercise reserved stream behavior (Section 6.2.3) with some of the unidirectional streams they are permitted to use.
{:/comment}

Each SIP-over-QUIC user agent MUST create at least one unidirectional stream for the SIP-over-QUIC control stream. If
the QPACK dynamic table is used, then each endpoint will open two additional unidirectional streams each. Other
extensions might require further unidirectional streams. Therefore, the transport parameters sent by both endpoints MUST
allow the peer to create at least three unidirectional streams. These transport parameters SHOULD also provide at least
1,024 bytes of flow-control credit to each unidirectional stream.

If the stream header indicates a stream type that is not supported by the recipient, the receiver MUST abort reading
the stream, discard incoming data without further processing, and reset the stream with the SIP_STREAM_CREATION_ERROR
error code. The recipient MUST NOT consider unknown stream types to be a connection error of any kind.

Since certain stream types can affect connection state, a recipient user agent SHOULD NOT discard data from incoming
unidirectional streams prior to reading the stream type.

Implementations SHOULD wait for the reception of a SETTINGS frame describing what stream types their peer user agent
supports before sending streams of that type. Implementations MAY send stream types that do not modify the state or
semantics of existing protocol components before it is known whether the peer user agent supports them, but MUST NOT
send stream types that do (such as QPACK).

A sender can close or reset a unidirectional stream unless otherwise specified. A receiver MUST tolerate unidirectional
streams being closed or reset prior to the reception of the unidirectional stream header.

### Control Streams {#control-streams}

A control stream is indicated by a stream type of `0x00`. Data on this stream consists of SIP-over-QUIC frames, as
defined in {{framing-layer}}.

Each SIP-over-QUIC user agent MUST initiate a single control stream at the beginning of the connection and send its
`SETTINGS` frame as the first frame on this stream. If the first frame of the control stream is any other frame type,
this MUST be treated as a connection error of type SIP_MISSING_SETTINGS. Only one control stream is permitted per user
agent; receipt of a second stream claiming to be a control stream MUST be treated as a connection error of type
SIP_STREAM_CREATION_ERROR.

The control stream MUST NOT be closed by the sender, and the receiver MUST NOT request that the sender close the
control stream. If either control stream is closed at any point, this MUST be treated as a connection error of type
SIP_CLOSED_CRITICAL_STREAM.

Connection errors are described in {{error-handling}}.

Because the contents of the control stream are used to manage the behaviour of other streams, user agents SHOULD provide
enough flow-control credit to keep the peer's control stream from becoming blocked.

# SIP Methods {#methods}

The `REGISTER`, `INVITE`, `ACK` and `BYE` methods as described in {{SIP2.0}} continue to operate in SIP-over-QUIC as
they do in SIP running over other transport protocols.

The `CANCEL` method MUST NOT be used in SIP-over-QUIC. If a SIP-over-QUIC request needs to be cancelled, the `CANCEL`
frame SHOULD be used instead, or the stream for that request reset using the QUIC `RESET_STREAM` frame
({{Section 19.4 of QUIC-TRANSPORT}}). Note that SIP-over-QUIC messages in flight at the time may still arrive on a
stream before the cancellation is received and processed by the peer.

> **Author's note:** I have not done a comprehensive review of all SIP/2.0 extensions and their applicability to this
document, so I invite feedback on any other methods that may be problematic.

# SIP Framing Layer {#framing-layer}

SIP-over-QUIC frames are carried on QUIC streams, as described in {{stream-mapping}}. SIP-over-QUIC defines a single
stream type: the Request Stream. This section describes SIP-over-QUIC frame formats; see {{frame-types}} for an
overview.

| Frame    | Request Stream | Control Stream | Section            |
|:---------|:---------------|:---------------|:-------------------|
| DATA     | Yes            | No             | {{data-frame}}     |
| HEADERS  | Yes            | No             | {{headers-frame}}  |
| CANCEL   | No             | Yes            | {{cancel-frame}}   |
| SETTINGS | No             | Yes            | {{settings-frame}} |
{: #frame-types "SIP-over-QUIC Frames"}

*[DATA]: #data-frame
*[HEADERS]: #headers-frame
*[CANCEL]: #cancel-frame
*[SETTINGS]: #settings-frame

Note that, unlike QUIC frames, SIP-over-QUIC frames can span multiple QUIC or UDP packets.

## Frame Layout {#frame-layout}

All frames have the following format:

~~~
SIP-over-QUIC Frame Format {
  Type (i),
  Length (i),
  Frame Payload (...)
}
~~~
{: #fig-sip-frame-format title="SIP-over-QUIC Frame Format"}

A frame includes the following fields:

* Type: A variable-length integer that identifies the frame type.

* Length: A variable-length integer that describes the length in bytes of the Frame Payload.

* Frame Payload: A payload, the semantics of which are determined by the Type field.

Each frame's payload MUST contain exactly the fields identified in its description. A frame payload that contains
additional bytes after the identified fields of a frame payload that terminates before the end of the identified
fields MUST be treated as a connection error of type SIP_FRAME_ERROR.

When a stream terminates cleanly, if the last frame on the stream was truncated, this MUST be treated as a connection
error of type SIP_FRAME_ERROR. Streams that terminate abruptly may be reset at any point in a frame.

## Frame Definitions {#frame-definitions}

### DATA {#data-frame}

`DATA` frames (type=`0x00`) are only sent on Request Streams. The frame payload carried in the Data field conveys
an arbitrary, variable-length sequences of bytes associated with a SIP-over-QUIC request or response message.

`DATA` frames MUST be associated with a SIP request or response.

~~~
DATA Frame {
  Type (i) = 0x00,
  Length (i),
  Data (..)
}
~~~
{: #fig-sip-data-frame-format title="DATA Frame"}

### HEADERS {#headers-frame}

`HEADERS` frames (type=`0x01`) are only sent on Request Streams. They are used to carry the collection of SIP
header fields associated with a SIP request or response message, as described in {{header-fields}}. The payload,
carried in Encoded Field Section, is encoded using {{QPACK}}.

~~~
HEADERS Frame {
  Type (i) = 0x01,
  Length (i),
  Encoded Field Section (..)
}
~~~
{: #fig-sip-headers-frame-format title="HEADERS Frame"}

### CANCEL {#cancel-frame}

The `CANCEL` frame (type=`0x02`) is only sent on a Control Stream and informs the receiver that its peer user agent
does not intend to do any further processing on the message carried by the associated bidirectional stream ID. If
the receiver has already completed the processing for the message, sent the response and closed the sending end of
the stream, it MUST disregard this frame.

> **Author's Note:** Remove the length from this frame type as the stream ID field is self-describing.

~~~
CANCEL Frame {
  Type (i) = 0x02,
  Length (i),
  Stream ID (i)
}
~~~
{: #fig=sip-cancel-frame-format title="CANCEL Frame"}

Senders MUST NOT send this frame with a stream ID that has not been acknowledged by its peer. A user agent that
receives a `CANCEL` frame with a stream ID that has not yet been opened MUST respond with a connection error of type
SIP_CANCEL_STREAM_CLOSED error.

### SETTINGS {#settings-frame}

The `SETTINGS` frame (type=`0x04`) is only sent on a Control Stream. It conveys configuration parameters that affect
how SIP-over-QUIC user agents communicate, such as preferences and constraints on peer behaviour. The parameters always
apply to an entire SIP-over-QUIC connection, never to a single transaction. A `SETTINGS` frame MUST be sent as the first
frame of each Control Stream by each peer user agent, and it MUST NOT be sent subsequently. If a SIP-over-QUIC user
agent receives a second `SETTINGS` frame on the control stream, or any other stream, the user agent MUST respond with a
connection error of type SIP_FRAME_UNEXPECTED.

`SETTINGS` parameters are not negotiated; they describe characteristics of the sending user agent that can be used by
the receiving user agent. However, a negotiation can be implied by the use of `SETTINGS`: each user agent uses
`SETTINGS` to advertise a set of supported values. Each user agent combines the two sets to conclude which choice will
be used. `SETTINGS` does not provide a mechanism to identify when the choice takes effect.

Different values for the same parameter can be advertised by the two user agents.

The same parameter MUST NOT occur more than once in the `SETTINGS` frame. A receiver MAY treat the presence of
duplicate setting identifiers as a connection error of type SIP_SETTINGS_ERROR.

The payload of a `SETTINGS` frame consists of zero or more parameters. Each parameter consists of a parameter
identifier and a value, both encoded as QUIC variable-length integers.

~~~
Parameter {
  Identifier (i),
  Value (i)
}

SETTINGS Frame {
  Type (i) = 0x04,
  Length (i),
  Parameter (..) ...
}
~~~
{: #fig-sip-settings-frame-format title="SETTINGS Frame"}

An implementation MUST ignore any parameter with an identifier it does not understand.

#### Defined SETTINGS Parameters {#defined-settings}

The following parameters are defined in SIP-over-QUIC:

SETTINGS_QPACK_MAX_TABLE_CAPACITY (`0x01`):
: The default value is zero. See {{header-fields}} for usage.
  {: anchor="SETTINGS_QPACK_MAX_TABLE_CAPACITY"}

SETTINGS_MAX_FIELD_SECTION_SIZE (`0x06`):
: The default value is unlimited. See {{header-fields}} for usage.
  {: anchor="SETTINGS_MAX_FIELD_SECTION_SIZE"}

SETTINGS_QPACK_BLOCKED_STREAMS (`0x07`):
: The default value is zero. See {{header-fields}} for usage.
  {: anchor="SETTINGS_QPACK_BLOCKED_STREAMS"}

*[SETTINGS_QPACK_MAX_TABLE_CAPACITY]: #
*[SETTINGS_MAX_FIELD_SECTION_SIZE]: #
*[SETTINGS_QPACK_BLOCKED_STREAMS]: #

# Error Handling {#error-handling}

When a request cannot be completed successfully, or if there is an issue with the underlying QUIC stream, QUIC allows
the application protocol to abruptly reset that stream and communicate a reason (see {{Section 2.4 of QUIC-TRANSPORT}}.
This is referred to as a "stream error". A SIP-over-QUIC implementation can decide to close a QUIC stream and
communicate the type of error. The wire encoding of error codes is defined in {{error-codes}}. Stream errors are
distinct from SIP status codes that indicate error conditions. Stream errors indicate that the sender did not transfer
or consume the full request or response message, while SIP status codes indicate the result of a request that was
successfully received and processed by the recipient.

If an entire connection needs to be terminated, QUIC similarly provides mechanisms to communicate a reason (see
{{Section 5.3 of QUIC-TRANSPORT}}). This is referred to as a "connection error". Similar to stream errors, a
SIP-over-QUIC implementation can terminate a QUIC connection and communicate the reason using an error code from
{{error-codes}}.

Although called a "stream error", this does not necessarily indicate a problem with either the implementation or the
connection as a whole. Streams MAY also be reset if the result of a SIP response is no longer of interest to the user
agent client, see {{cancel-request}}.

{{extensions}} specifies that extensions may define new error codes without negotiation. Use of an unknown error code
or a known error code in an unexpected context MUST be treated as equivalent to SIP_NO_ERROR.

*[stream error]: #error-handling
*[stream errors]: #error-handling (((stream error)))
*[connection error]: #error-handling
*[connection errors]: #error-handling (((connection error)))

## SIP-over-QUIC Error Codes {#error-codes}

The following error codes are defined for use when abruptly terminating streams, aborting reading of streams, or
immediately closing SIP-over-QUIC connections.

SIP_NO_ERROR (0x0300):
: No error. This is used when the connection or stream needs to be closed, but there is no error to signal.
  {: anchor="SIP_NO_ERROR"}

SIP_GENERAL_PROTOCOL_ERROR (0x0301):
: Peer violated protocol requirements in a way that does not match a more specific error code or endpoint declines to

# Extensions to SIP-over-QUIC {#extensions}

SIP-over-QUIC permits extension of the protocol. Within the limitations described in this section, protocol extensions
can be used to provide additional services or alter any aspect of the protocol. Extensions are effective only within the
scope of a single SIP-over-QUIC connection.

This applies only to the protocol elements defined in this document. This does not affect the existing options for
extending SIP, such as defining new methods, status codes or header fields.

Extensions are permitted to use new frame types ({{frame-definitions}}), new settings ({{defined-settings}}), new error
codes ({{error-codes}}), or new stream types ({{stream-mapping}}).

> **RFC Editor's Note:** Establish registries for frame types, settings, error codes and stream types.

Implementations MUST ignore unknown or unsupported values in all extensible protocol elements. This means that any of
these extension points can be safely used by extensions without prior arrangement or negotiation. However, where a
known frame type is required to be in a specific location, such as the SETTINGS frame (see {{control-streams}}), an
unknown frame type does not satisfy that requirement and SHOULD be treated as an error.

Extensions that could change the semantics of existing protocol components MUST be negotiated before being used. For
example, an extension that allows the multiplexing of other protocols such as media transport protocols over
bidirectional QUIC streams MUST NOT be used until the peer user agent has given a positive signal that this is
acceptable.

This document does not mandate a specific method for negotiating the use of any extension, but it notes that a
parameter ({{defined-settings}}) could be used for that purpose. If both peer user agents set a value that indicates
willingness to use the extension, then the extension can be used. If a parameter is used in this way, the default
value MUST be defined in such a way that the extension is disabled if the setting is omitted.

# Future Carriage of Media Sessions {#media-sessions}

> **Author's Note:** This section is intended to foster discussion around how the QUIC transport connection established
and used by SIP-over-QUIC could be also used for carriage of media.

> **RFC Editor's Note:** Please remove this section prior to publication of a final version of this document.

Future versions of this specification may include support for carrying media sessions within the same QUIC transport
connection as SIP-over-QUIC, with the intention being that they will be negotiated using the SDP offer/answer mechanism.

There already exists several attempts to define carriage of media over QUIC transport, such as {{QRT}},
{{RTP-over-QUIC}}, {{QuicR-Arch}}, {{RUSH}} and {{Warp}}.

In the case of media carried in QUIC datagrams, a user agent cannot propose sending media using this mechanism unless
its peer has indicated its support for receiving datagrams by means of the `max_datagram_frame_size` parameter as
described in {{Section 3 of QUIC-DATAGRAMS}}.

In the case of media carried in QUIC streams, if the media streams are transmitted using unidirectional streams, then
new stream types will need to be defined. This document reserves the stream type value 0x04 for this, see
{{unidirectional-streams}}. In the unlikely case where media streams are to be transmitted using bidirectional streams,
the stream type mechanism will need to be extended to cover bidirectional streams, because this specification currently
assumes that SIP-over-QUIC messages have exclusive use of the bidirectional streams.

## Carriage Of RTP In A QUIC Transport Session

Both {{QRT}} and {{RTP-over-QUIC}} define ways to carry RTP and RTCP messages over QUIC `DATAGRAM` frames. With SIP
and SDP already closely aligned with RTP media sessions, adapting SIP-over-QUIC to coexist within the same QUIC
transport connection as RTP/RTCP would save at least one network round trip.

* QRT only defines a way to carry RTP and RTCP in QUIC `DATAGRAM` frames.
* RTP-over-QUIC defines a way to carry RTP and RTCP over QUIC `STREAM` frames (without specifying whether they are
to be sent over bidirectional or unidirectional streams) as well as QUIC `DATAGRAM` frames.

In addition, QRT attempts to define SDP attributes to allow the negotiation of QRT sessions in SIP. {{SDP-QUIC}}
also describes a different set of SDP attributes to perform a similar task.

Future versions of this document or the above documents may specify a mechanism for signalling that a given media
session will be carried in the same QUIC connection as the SIP-over-QUIC session.

## Carriage Of Non-RTP Media Streaming Protocols In A QUIC Transport Session

{{RUSH}} does not specify a means to discover the presence of a RUSH streaming session, nor a mechanism for negotiating
the encoding parameters of media that is being exchanged. RUSH has two modes of operation: Normal and Multi Stream
modes. Normal mode, as described in {{Section 4.3.1 of RUSH}}, uses a single bidirectional QUIC stream to send and
receive media streams. Multi Stream mode, as described in {{Section 4.3.2 of RUSH}}, uses a bidirectional QUIC
stream for each individual media frame. Bidirectional streams appear to be used in order to give error feedback, as
opposed to having a separate control stream for handling errors or using the QUIC transport error mechanism. If the
stream type mechanism described in {{unidirectional-streams}} is expanded to cover bidirectional streams as well, then
SIP-over-QUIC could be used with RUSH.

{{Warp}} specifies that sessions are established using HTTP/3 WebTransport ({{WebTransH3}}). However, to the author's
best knowledge WebTransport does not yet contain any signalling or media negotiation similar to how WebRTC would use
SDP offer/answer exchanges, so some form of session establishment mechanism like SIP-over-QUIC could be useful in
filling this gap. Warp uses QUIC unidirectional streams for sending media. Similar to MPEG-DASH, media is sent in
ISO-BMFF "segments", with each stream carrying a single segment. This can easily be accommodated by the media stream
type reserved in {{unidirectional-streams}}.

{{QuicR-Arch}} is openly hostile to the usage of SDP, and {{QuicR-Proto}} defines the QuicR Manifest for advertising
media sessions and endpoint capabilities and, as such, SIP-over-QUIC probably isn't required.

# Security Considerations

The security considerations of SIP-over-QUIC should be comparable to those of {{SIP2.0}} and {{HTTP3}}.

SIP-over-QUIC relies on QUIC, which itself relies on TLS 1.3 and thus supports by default the protections against
downgrade attacks described in {{!BCP195}}. QUIC-specific issues and their mitigations are described in
{{Section 21 of QUIC-TRANSPORT}}.

{{transactions}} gives specific guidance on the conversion of transactions between SIP-over-QUIC and carriage of SIP
over other transport protocols which make use of the branch parameter, in order to avoid leaking details of the
underlying QUIC transport connection.

# IANA Considerations

> **Author's Note**: This section of the document reflects future IANA registrations, and not current ones. The
intention is for these registrations to occur once this Internet-Draft becomes an RFC.

This document registers a new ALPN protocol IDs ({{iana-alpn}}) and creates new registries that manage the assignment
of code points in SIP-over-QUIC ({{iana-registries}}).

## Registration Of SIP Identification Strings {#iana-alpn}

This document creates a new registration of SIP-over-QUIC in the "TLS Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation (ALPN)
Protocol IDs" registry established in {{?RFC7301}}.

The "sips/quic" string identifies SIP-over-QUIC:

  Protocol:
  : SIP-over-QUIC

  Identification Sequence:
  : 0x73 0x69 0x70 0x73 0x2F 0x71 0x75 0x69 0x63 ("sips/quic")

  Specification:
  : This document

This document creates a new registration of SIP/2.0 over TLS in the "TLS Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation (ALPN)
Protocol IDs" registry established in {{?RFC7301}}.

The "sips/2.0" string identifies SIP/2.0 over TLS:

  Protocol:
  : SIP/2.0 over TLS

  Identification Sequence:
  : 0x73 0x69 0x70 0x73 0x2F 0x32 0x2E 0x30 ("sips/2.0")

  Specification:
  : {{SIP2.0}}

This document creates a new registration of SIP/2.0 over UDP in the "TLS Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation (ALPN)
Protocol IDs" registry established in {{?RFC7301}}.

The "sip/2.0" string identifies SIP/2.0 over UDP:

  Protocol:
  : SIP/2.0 over UDP

  Identification Sequence:
  : 0x73 0x69 0x70 0x2F 0x32 0x2E 0x30 ("sip/2.0")

  Specification:
  : {{SIP2.0}}

## New Registries {#iana-registries}

New registries created in this document operate under the QUIC registration policy documented in
{{Section 22.1 of QUIC-TRANSPORT}}. These registries all include the common set of fields listed in
{{Section 22.1.1 of QUIC-TRANSPORT}}. These registries are collected under the "Session Initiation Protocol over QUIC
Transport (SIP-over-QUIC)" heading.

The initial allocations in these registries are all assigned permanent status and list a change controller of the IETF
and a contact of the _\[TBC\]_ working group.

### Frame Types {#iana-frames}

This document establishes a registry for SIP-over-QUIC frame type codes. The "SIP-over-QUIC Frame Types" registry
governs a 62-bit space. This registry follows the QUIC registry policy; see {{iana-registries}}. Permanent registrations
in this registry are assigned using the Specification Required policy {{!RFC8126}}), except for values between `0x00`
and `0x3f` (in hexadecimal; inclusive), which are assigned using Standards Action or IESG Approval as defined in
{{Sections 4.9 and 4.10 of RFC8126}}.

In addition to common fields as described in {{iana-registries}}, permanent registrations in this registry MUST
include the following fields:

Frame type:
: A name or label for the frame type.

Specifications of frame types MUST include a description of the frame layout and its semantics, including any parts of
the frame that are conditionally present.

The entries in {{fig-iana-frame-table}} are registered by this document.

### Settings Parameters {#iana-parameters}

This document establishes a registry for SIP-over-QUIC parameters. The "SIP-over-QUIC Parameters" registry governs a
62-bit space. This registry follows the QUIC registry policy; see {{iana-registries}}. Permanent registrations in this
registry are assigned using the Specification Required policy {{!RFC8126}}), except for values between `0x00` and `0x3f`
(in hexadecimal; inclusive), which are assigned using Standards Action or IESG Approval as defined in
{{Sections 4.9 and 4.10 of RFC8126}}.

In addition to common fields as described in {{iana-registries}}, permanent registrations in this registry MUST include
the following fields:

Parameter Name:
: A symbolic name for the parameter. Specifying a parameter name is optional.

Default:
: The value of the parameter unless otherwise indicated. A default SHOULD be the most restrictive possible value.

The entries in {{fig-iana-parameter-table}} are registered by this document.

### Error Codes {#iana-error-codes}

This document establishes a registry for SIP-over-QUIC error codes. The "SIP-over-QUIC Error Codes" registry governs a
62-bit space. This registry follows the QUIC registry policy; see {{iana-registries}}. Permanent registrations in this
registry are assigned using the Specification Required policy {{!RFC8126}}), except for values between `0x0300` and
`0x033f` (in hexadecimal; inclusive), which are assigned using Standards Action or IESG Approval as defined in
{{Sections 4.9 and 4.10 of RFC8126}}.

In addition to common fields as described in {{iana-registries}}, permanent registrations in this registry MUST include
the following fields:

Name:
: A name for the error code.

Description:
: A brief description of the error code semantics.

The entries in {{fig-iana-error-table}} are registered by this document. These error codes were selected from the range
that operates on a Specification Required policy to avoid collisions with HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 error codes.

### Stream Types {#iana-stream-types}

This document establishes a registry for SIP-over-QUIC stream types. The "SIP-over-QUIC Stream Types" registry governs a
62-bit space. This registry follows the QUIC registry policy; see {{iana-registries}}. Permanent registrations in this
registry are assigned using the Specification Required policy {{!RFC8126}}), except for values between `0x00` and `0x3f`
(in hexadecimal; inclusive), which are assigned using Standards Action or IESG Approval as defined in
{{Sections 4.9 and 4.10 of RFC8126}}.

In addition to common fields as described in {{iana-registries}}, permanent registrations in this registry MUST include
the following fields:

Stream Type:
: A name or label for the stream type.

Sender:
: Which endpoint on a SIP-over-QUIC connection may initiate a stream of this type. Values are "Client", "Server", or
"Both".

# QPACK Static Table {#static-table}

> **Author's Note:** This is only a preliminary table. The original HPACK static table was created after analysing the
frequency of common HTTP header fields and their values. QPACK repeated that effort at a later date, which resulted in
a different static table. The author welcomes any data that would permit a similar level of analysis for the frequency
of common SIP header fields and their values.
